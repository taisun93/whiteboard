# Local dev: copy to .env and fill in. On Render, set these in the dashboard (Environment), not in a file.
# See README "Deploy to Render" for the list.

# Google Sign-In (required for auth)
# Create OAuth 2.0 credentials at https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
# Application type: Web application
# Authorized redirect URIs in Google Console: add BOTH http://localhost:3000/api/auth/google/callback AND your live URL (e.g. https://your-app.onrender.com/api/auth/google/callback)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret

# Optional: base URL for OAuth redirect. If unset, the app uses the request host (works behind Render/Heroku proxies). Set only if you need to override (e.g. custom domain behind proxy).
# BASE_URL=https://your-app.onrender.com

# PostgreSQL: users, whiteboards (many-to-many with users), sessions, and per-whiteboard state.
# If unset: in-memory sessions only, single shared board, no persistence.
# On Render: use the Internal Database URL from your Postgres service.
# DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:5432/dbname

# Optional: Redis-compatible store. If set, used for: (1) session cache (shared across instances);
# (2) whiteboard state — when Postgres is set, Redis caches board state for faster load and multi-instance sync;
# when Postgres is not set, the single default board is persisted in Redis so it survives restarts.
# On Render: New → Key Value, same region as Web Service; add Internal Connection URL as REDIS_URL.
# REDIS_URL=redis://host:6379
